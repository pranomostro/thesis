\chapter{Terms and Definitions}\label{chapter:terms}

This paper uses some terms and abbreviations that are common in the
literature on test suite reduction, but not used much elsewhere.

The System Under Test (SUT) is a software system being tested using a
test suite.

The Test Suite Reduction (TSR) is a metric that evaluates the magnitude
of the reduction of a test suite. Given a test suite $T=\{t_1, \dots t_n\}$ and
a reduced test suite $T' \subset T$, the TSR of the test suite is determined
using the formula

$$\hbox{TSR}(T, T')=\frac{|T|-|T'|}{|T|}$$

Everything else equal, higher values for TSR are better.

The abbreviation TSR also sometimes stands for the technique of test
suite reduction, i.e. the permanent removal of redundant test cases
from a test suite. In this text, "TSR" will only stand for the metric,
and the technique will be written out as "test suite reduction".

The Fault Detection Loss (FDL) is a metric that evaluates the amount of
faults detected by a reduced test suite. Let $F$ be the faults detected
by $T$, and $F'$ be the faults detected by $T'$, then the fault detection
loss is calculated as such:

$$\hbox{FDL}(F, F')=\frac{|F|-|F'|}{|F|}$$

In general, lower FDL values are better. A related metric (e.g. used in
\cite{khan2016survey} or \cite{yoo2012regression}) is the Fault Detection
Effectiveness (FDE), defined as $1-FDE(F, F')$.
