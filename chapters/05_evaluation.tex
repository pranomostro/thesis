\section{Research Questions}

\paragraph{Research Question 1: Does the Relative Effectiveness of the Different Algorithms Replicate the Results in \cite{cruciani2019scalable}?}

\subparagraph{Research Question 1.1: Does Their Relative Effectiveness in TSR Replicate the Findings
in \cite{cruciani2019scalable}?}

\subparagraph{Research Question 1.2: Does Their Relative Effectiveness in FDL Replicate the Findings in \cite{cruciani2019scalable}?}

\paragraph{Research Question 2: Does the Relative Runtime Performance of the Different Algorithms Replicate the Results in \cite{cruciani2019scalable}?}

\paragraph{Research Question 3: How Much Better Than Random Selection are Specialized Algorithms?}

\paragraph{(Possibly) Research Question 4: Do the Results in \cite{cruciani2019scalable} Replicate with the Original Test Data?}
