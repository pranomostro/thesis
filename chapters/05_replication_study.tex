%CANDO: where to put the information about bugs discovered in the original code?

17 pages

\section{Research Questions}

We define five %CANDO: change the number if we add/drop research questions
research questions, adapting three from \cite{cruciani2019scalable}
and adding two further questions.

\subparagraph{Research Question 1.1: Can the relative effectiveness in TSR be replicated on other study objects?}

We care about the size of the reduced test suite, therefore it is valuable
by how much test suites are reduced. We use the TSR metric (defined
in terms and definitions) to evaluate the magnitude of the reduction.
Using the TSR is mostly useful in adequate scenarios, since in inadequate
scenarios, the size of the reduced test suite relative to the original
test suite is fixed. We rank the algorithms using a Kruskal-Wallis test,
taken from \cite{cruciani2019scalable}

\subparagraph{Research Question 1.2: Can the relative effectiveness in FDL be replicated on other study objects?}

\cite{rothermel2002empirical} finds that test suite reduction can severely
compromise fault detection capability. To test whether this is the case,
the FDL metric is used to examine the fault detection capabilities
for the algorithms given new data. We also rank the methods using a
Kruskal-Wallis test.

\paragraph{Research Question 2: Can the relative runtime performance of the different algorithms be replicated?}

Due to using different datasets (of both larger and smaller size), the
absolute runtimes of the different test suite reduction methods can be
expected to be different from the original runs. However, the ordering of
the methods according to runtime is expected to be the same (that is, if
algorithm $X$ was faster than algorithm $Y$ on the old data, we can expect
algorithm $X$ to also be faster than algorithm $Y$ on the new data).

Again, we use the Kruskal-Wallis test to rank methods after their
runtime performance.

\paragraph{Research Question 3: How much better than random selection are specialized algorithms?}

\paragraph{(Possibly) Research Question 4: Can the results be reproduced with the original test data?}

\section{Study Design}

\section{Study Objects}

\section{Selecting Projects}

The code bases and test suites selected for this study were small to
medium sized open-source Java projects. They all used either JUnit
4 or JUnit 5 as their testing framework, and the tool Maven %CANDO: right capitalization?
for building and testing. We used the latest version.

The projects used, their versions and size are presented in table CANDO
(project and test suite size are in lines of code, the version is the
6-digit prefix of the git commit used).

\begin{table}[htpb]
	\caption[]{}\label{tab:projects} %Project name, version, size of test suite, size of project, link to project
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}
		\toprule
		Project name & Version & Project size & Test-suite size & Number of tests \\
		\midrule
		assertj-core & cb2829 & 135k & 241k &3578 \\
		commons-collections & 242918 & 59k & 45k & 238 \\

		jsoup & 89580c & 18k & 12k & 52\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%CANDO: include number of test cases?

\section{Study Setup}

Testing the performance of the algorithms required three different kinds
of information: the contents of the test suites, coverage information
and fault information.

\subsection{Combining Tests Suites}

For every examined project, the test suite was converted into a format
suitable for the code from \cite{cruciani2019scalable} by replacing the
newlines from each test with spaces and concatenating the tests into
one file (the \textbf{black-box file}), such that every line contained
one test case.

For some of the projects, test cases were excluded since they failed
during the default test run:

%CANDO: make second column multi-line

\begin{table}[htpb]
	\caption[]{}\label{tab:excluded} %Project name, excluded tests
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | p{10cm}}
		\toprule
		Project name & Test classes excluded \\
		\midrule
		assertj-core & BDDSoftAssertionsTest, SoftAssertionsTest, SoftAssertions\_overriding\_afterAssertionErrorCollected\_Test, SoftAssertionsErrorsCollectedTest, SoftAssertionsMultipleProjectsTest, SoftAssertions\_setAfterAssertionErrorCollected\_Test, AssertJMultipleFailuresError\_getMessage\_Test \\
		commons-collections & BulkTest \\
		commons-lang & FieldUtilsTest \\
		commons-math & FastMathTest, EvaluationTestValidation \\
		jopt-simple & / \\
		jsoup & / \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Generating Coverage Information}

Coverage information was generated using jacoco with the testwise mode
of the teamscale jacoco agent. %CANDO link

Since the teamscale jacoco agent only supports line coverage, other
types of coverage had to be eschewed.

%CANDO: add note about how line coverage subsumes branch & function coverage?

The json files created by the teamscale jacoco agent were converted
from JSON into the format used by \cite{cruciani2019scalable}: a file
containing a list of numbers in each line, with the numbers $n_1, \dots
n_i$ in line $n$ corresponding to the source lines of code in the tested
project covered by the test case at line $n$ in the \textbf{black-box
file}.

\subsection{Collecting Fault Coverage Information}

%Cite Budd TA. Mutation analysis of program test data

Fault detection information was not available for the projects used,
and was therefore generated by mutation testing using the mutation
testing framework pitest.

The generated mutation test data was converted from XML to the format used
in the code of \cite{cruciani2019scalable}: a text file containing a list
of number per line, the numbers at line $n$ corresponding to different
classes for which the test case at line $n$ in the \textbf{black-box file}
did find faults.

\section{Results}

To obtain the results, we executed the code originally written for
\cite{cruciani2019scalable} with the newly generated test data.

We include the mean in the descriptive statistics to illustrate that
while the median adequate reduction has no fault detection loss, it can
nonetheless still occur.
