As a response to ever-growing test suites with long runtimes, several
different approaches have been developed to reduce the time for test
suite execution to give useful results. One of these approaches is test
suite reduction: selecting a sample of tests that maximizes coverage on
the tested source code. This paper attempts to replicate the findings
in \cite{cruciani2019scalable}, which borrows techniques from big
data to handle very large test suites. We use independently generated
testing data from open source projects, and find that TODO.
