I thank my parents providing me food, shelter and emotional support
while I was researching and writing this thesis, my advisors Roman Haas
and Raphael NÃ¶mmer for their detailed technical and textual feedback,
and the authors of \cite{cruciani2019scalable} for their quick responses
to my inquiries about their paper.
